## Cloud Security

**Securing** cloud resources involves implementing measures and best practices to protect data, applications and infrastructure deployed in a cloud environment from unauthorized access, data breaches and other security threats. Cloud security is a shared responsibility between the **cloud service provider** (CSP) and the **cloud user** (customer).

### Shared Responsibility Model

|     Cloud Architecture      | e.g. Responsibility for IaaS | e.g. Responsibility for PaaS |
| :-------------------------: | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
|          Workload           | User                         | User                         |
|          Services           | User                         | CSP                          |
|      Virtual Machines       | User                         | CSP                          |
|       *Control Plane*       | CSP                          | CSP                          |
|     **Virtualization**      | CSP                          | CSP                          |
| **Physical Infrastructure** | CSP                          | CSP                          |
|    **Physical Facility**    | CSP                          | CSP                          |

From a security standpoint, the responsibility depends on what level of service is used.

A the level of **data plane** and **control plane** (tools, consoles, CLI, SDK), securing cloud resources is important and IAM is a key aspect of it.

- Identity protection
- Strong authentication mechanisms
- Control access
- Data encryption
- Network security
- Patching and updates

**Security measures must be applied to both the data and the control plane.**

### Defense in depth

[Defense in depth](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/security/glossary/what-is-defense-in-depth/) (layered security) is a principle and strategy in cloud security that involves implementing multiple layers of security controls and measures to protect cloud resources from various threats and attacks.

- Robust and resilient posture
- Mitigate the risk of a single security control

Public Network (Perimeter)

- Public **firewall**, DDos Prevention, IDS/IPS, etc

Local Network

- nACL, Device **Hardening**, Monitoring, etc

Operating System (Endpoint)

- Hardening, **Patching**, Endpoint Protection, **Monitoring**, etc

Service (Application)

- **Hardening**, Patching, Monitoring, Vuln Scanning, Testing, etc

Workload

- Authentication, Authorization, Auditing, Data access control, Monitoring, **Encryption** (in transit & at rest), MFA, etc
